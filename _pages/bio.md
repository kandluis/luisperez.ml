Hi all, and welcome to my home on the web! I'm Luis, a Software Leader at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), making cars understand agent behavior by scaling large multimodal models, using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, and deploying large-scale, distributed infrastructure.

I was previously at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) (formerly known as Facebook), [re-engineering Meta AI's deep learning platforms for vision, text, and audio](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/reengineering-facebook-ais-deep-learning-platforms-for-interoperability/). Before that, I worked on graph neural networks at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com), advancing the state-of-the-art in [traffic prediction](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks) and learned the art of large-scale distributed systems at Google by building [Procella](https://research.google/pubs/pub48388/). I've also given several lectures at [North Carolina A&T University](https://www.ncat.edu/) and developed the curriculum for [Algorithm Foundations for AI and Cybersecurity](https://kandluis.github.io/algorithms-course/)

I spend my free time [doing research for fun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WdafpDsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have a MS in Computer Science from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), advised by [Doug James](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~djames/) and working with [Jurij Leskovek](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jure-leskovec). I specialized in artificial intelligence and CS theory - focusing on convolutional neural networks and sequence models for image and language understanding and graph neural networks for [geometric deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cxhvQK9ALQ). I also have a BA from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) in computer science and mathematics.

I am the co-author of [The Effectiveness of Data Augmentation in Image Classification using Deep Learning
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04621) and [ETA Predictions with Graph Neural Networks in Google Maps](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459637.3481916). I worked to take my research to production, [substantially improving the travel-time predictions](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks) in [Google Maps](https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-101-how-ai-helps-predict-traffic-and-determine-routes/) (featured across several media outlets such as [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/covid-19-forced-google-maps-to-change-how-it-predicts-traffic.html), [Engaget](https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-deep-mind-ai-accuracy-140005698.html), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/03/deepmind-claims-its-ai-improved-google-maps-travel-time-estimates-by-up-to-50/), [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/heres-how-google-maps-uses-ai-to-predict-traffic-and-calculate-routes/), the [Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419632/how-google-maps-predicts-traffic-eta-ai-machine-learning-deepmind), and [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-maps-and-deepmind-enhance-ai-capabilities-to-improve-route-calculations/)).

My work and mission
======
I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate and solve large-scale problems across products used by billions. Most of my work focuses on building technical solutions to technical problems. I love working to promote positive user content by teaching machines to understand text, image, and video. I like making positive social impact, such as reducing carbon emissions from vehicles by developing novel routing algorithms for Google Maps, and improving YouTubeâ€™s video recommendations through advanced deep learning techniques.

I live by the following principles:

- **Focus on Long-Term Individual Growth**: Maximize potential for growth (people skills, technical skills, leadership skills) to build strong/clear foundation to "change the world" (eg, being a lever that makes the difference)
- **Create Positive External Impact**: My work must make people's lives better, provide a clear positive service and add direct value. It is not enough to work on something "big" or "important" - the work has to be a net positive for the world.
- **Build Great Systems**: I work on teams that are leaders - focused on building great products for users, great systems for us. My teams are not "fast followers" or "catching-up" - we are leading because we are creating and building, working on hard problems, and pushing the boundaries of our domain. This also applies to non-technical support systems for individuals to grow.
- **Be Kind**: Be direct, be empathetic, be supportive. How people feel matters, how the team feels matters. I work to build a culture of support and collaboration - avoiding individual competition and instead inspiring each other to be better.
- **Do The Right Thing**: We do what's right, even if it's more costly or difficult. We correct and monitor progress, but our guiding principle is to do the right thing.
