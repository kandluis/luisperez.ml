Software Engineer/AI Researcher
======

Software Engineer and Technical Leader at Waymo with **8 years** experience in machine learning and **6+ years** with PyTorch and Tensorflow frameworks. Expert in **large-scale model training** for behavior prediction, multimodal content understanding, and ranking (eg. wayformer, transformers, graph attention networks, seq2seq models). <!--- # Technical lead supporting **60+ engineer** across behavior prediction and realism at Waymo. -->

Work Experience
======

## [2022 - ] Waymo | Software Engineer
> Software lead working across behavior prediction, planner, and simulation to improve trajectory modeling and driver realism.

## [2020 - 2022] Meta AI (formerly Facebook AI) | Software Engineer
> Technical lead working with 5 teams with 30+ engineers across key products (Instagram Reels, News Feed, and Marketplace)

* [Reengineered](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/reengineering-facebook-ais-deep-learning-platforms-for-interoperability/) Meta AIâ€™s multimodal content-understandplatform in PyTorch, leading migration of 100+ models
* Led development of [PyTorch Recipes](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes_index.html), enabling new modelsin IG Reels (+2.3% time spent) and Marketplace (+1.3% in CTR).
* Maintained reproducible SOTA results across video, text, and audio domains with >3K daily active developers.
* Accelerated growth of organization and established technical foundations, supporting over 800+ DAUs on SOTA models.
* Published across several venues with [>2.3k citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WdafpDsAAAAJ&hl=en) and experience across production training systems.


## [2022 -] North Carolina A&T University (Meta) | Visiting Faculty
> Lead instructor establishing novel algorithms for artifical intelligence and cyber-security, serving 400+ undergraduate and 20+ graduate students at the largest HBCU in the US.

* Created course ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0KKKLEqGOyIgXP_kzDFcS9OB807s2Ar5)) and led the instruction to 62 students of [COMP285: Algorithm Foundations forAI and Cyber-security](http://kandluis.github.io/algorithms-course)
* Achieved a course satisfaction of 4.5/5 (+18.8%) and NPS of 73 with >10% of students accepting full-time positions at Meta.

## [2018 - 2022] DeepMind (Alphabet) | Senior ResearchEngineer

> Technical lead for graph neural networks research team (7+ research engineers),collaborating across product areas (GoogleMaps, YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search) to deploy state of the art ML architectures for recommendation, ranking, and prediction.

* Productionized GNN-based model for [traffic estimation](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks) in Maps ([paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459637.3481916)) reducing negative ETA outcomes in 80+ regions compared to
production baseline (40+% in cities like Sydney, with average reduction of 18% globally).
* Productinized GNN-based model for video candidate generation for content filtering on YouTube recommendations, decreasing XLQ (eXtreme Low Quality) content by 20+% across key demographics (eg, young adult, lgbtq+).

## [2016 - 2018] Google (Alphabet) | Senior SoftwareEngineer

> Individual contributor to Procella leading support for structured queries, ETL pipelines, and map-reduce style execution.
